        <dd>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.</dd>
<p>It is the language that is used to structure web pages. HTML contains the content of a web page which users can see, and also some information that the user's browser interprets to format the content, but doesn't explicitly show to the user.</p>
    <dt><em>Elements and Tags</em></dt>
        <dd>These are called element tags. They inform the browser how to display the page. They look like this: <div>
    They almost always come with a closing tag somewhere later that looks like this: </div></dd>
<p>Whatever is between the opening tag and the closing tag is called an element. Let's create some...</p>
<p>In order to make a main header, we wrap the content of the header in an &lt;h1&gt; tag.</p>
And to set some content as a paragraph element, we use &lt;p&gt; tags.
