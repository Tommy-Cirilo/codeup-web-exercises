    <dt>How did Yellowstone get it's name?</dt>
    <dd>Yellowstone National Park is named after the Yellowstone River, the major
        river running through the park. According to French-Canadian trappers in the
        1800s, they asked the name of the river from the Minnetaree tribe, who live
        in what is now eastern Montana. They responded “Mi tse a-da-zi,” which
        literally translates as “Rock Yellow River.” The trappers translated this
        into French as “Roche Jaune” or “Pierre Jaune.” In 1797, explorer-geographer
        David Thompson used the English translation—“Yellow Stone.” Lewis and Clark
        called the Yellowstone River by the French and English forms. Subsequent use
        formalized the name as “Yellowstone.</dd>
